    <h1>101 Dalmatians - squash the bugs, not the dogs!</h1>
    <p>
      Your friend has been out shopping for puppies (what a time to be
      alive!)... <br />
      He arrives back with multiple dogs, and you simply do not know how to
      respond!<br />
      <br />
      By repairing the function provided, you will find out exactly how you
      should <br />
      respond, depending on the number of dogs he has.<br />
      <br />
      The number of dogs will always be a number and there will always be at
      least 1 dog.<br />
      <br />
      Good luck!<br />
